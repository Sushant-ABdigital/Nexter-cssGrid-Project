# Nexter-cssGrid-Project
This is the CSS grid project. Learned with Jonas on Udemy Platform through advanced CSS course.

This is the first project I started learning CSS Grid.

###### Benefit of using CSS grid.
* Placement of element on web page is easy.
* Less media queries to make it responsiveness.
* No requirement to use framework such as bootstrap and all.
